# Galaxy Foxy 🌌🦊 three universe

Ever wanted to generate your own galaxy? Of course not. But here’s **Galaxy Foxy** anyway! This project is a totally unnecessary, absolutely pointless galaxy generator made with Three.js. It started as an exercise for my students... and maybe because I was bored. Ok, fine, I admit it—I was very bored. 😂

## Why Use Galaxy Foxy? 🤔

Honestly, there’s no real reason. But if you’re:
- A Three.js enthusiast looking for some laughs,
- A bored developer with too much free time,
- Or just someone who likes shiny galaxies...

Then you’re in the right place! 🎉

## The Philosophy Behind Galaxy Foxy ✨

- **Why does it exist?** Because I needed something to do.
- **Who is it for?** Me, my students, and anyone else who thinks generating galaxies is a valid life choice.
- **Will it change your life?** Probably not. But hey, it might make you smile. 😎

### Final Thoughts 💭
This project is proof that sometimes the most fun ideas are the most pointless ones. So, go ahead, generate galaxies, pretend you’re the ruler of the universe, and then wonder why you’re doing this. 😅
